# standardcor: Empirical Null Models of Pairwise Correlations–Estimation and Standardization

This package addresses issues arising in using correlation coefficients
to determine adjacencies in network representations of systems of
interacting variables, such as measured quantities of gene transcripts,
proteins, metabolites, microRNAs, lipids, and any other related
measurements collected by high-throughput technologies employed in
molecular biological research. The methods here are not specific to this
application, they are statistical and intended to be of practical value
regardless of the field of application; however, the package was
motivated by issues arising in the stated application.
