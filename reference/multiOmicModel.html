<dl><dt id="arg-omicsl">OmicsL<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-omicsl"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A named list of datasets. Each dataset may be a matrix (internal dataset) or the name of an RDS file containing a matrix (external dataset). The matrices are interpreted as rows representing samples and columns representing analytes; the analyte names must be unique across all datasets.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-common">common<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-common"></a></dt>
<dd><p>When TRUE (the default), only samples common to all datasets will be used to compute correlations. Otherwise, correlations will be computed across all samples shared by each individual pair of datasets. While requiring all correlations to depend on a common set of samples, setting common to FALSE permits all available data to contribute to each cross-correlation; it is up to the user to decide when this is appropriate.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-min-samples">min.samples<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-min-samples"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A lower limit on the number of samples from which analyte-analyte correlations may be computed. This parameter is used to ensure that datasets overlap sufficiently on samples to provide at least a minimal ability to compute correlations between analytes. When a common set of samples is required across all datasets, this parameter is the minimum length of the common set of samples; otherwise the min.samples is the minimum number of samples shared by each pair of 'Omics datasets independently.</p></dd>

</dl></div>
    <div class="section level2">
    <h2 id="value">Value<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#value"></a></h2>
    <p>A list of two parts: 'modelL', a list of Beta distributon null models and raw correlation values for every pair of input ('Omics) datasets, and 'analyteL', a list of the analytes contributed by each 'Omics dataset. The standardized correlation matrix can be computed from these two lists using standardizeFromModel(), either directly or after adjustment of the individual null model parameters as needed. The rows and columns of the final standardized correlation matrix will be labeled by the full set of analytes listed in analyteL, which must be unique; no effort is made to render the analyte names unique in either of these functions.</p>
