Title: Empirical Null Models of Pairwise Correlations--Estimation and Standardization
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Max Robinson and Lance Pflieger
Maintainer: Max Robinson <max.robinson@isbscience.org>
Description: This package addresses issues arising in using correlation coefficients
    to determine adjacencies in network representations of systems of interacting variables,
    such as measured quantities of gene transcripts, proteins, metabolites, microRNAs,
    lipids, and any other related measurements collected by high-throughput technologies
    employed in molecular biological research. The methods here are not specific to this
    application, they are statistical and intended to be of practical value regardless of
    the field of application; however, the package was motivated by issues arising in the
    stated application.
