#' Replace non-zero entries in a sparse matrix with non-zero ranks
#'
#' Creates a rank matrix for a sparse matrix X using the following approach:
#' 1. Use non-zero enries in a column to calculate the ranks
#' 2. Add (z-1)/2 to the ranks (only non-zero entries are changed). z is the number of zeros
#' in the column
#' Since all the entries are shifted by the same constant (the zeros
#' are already shifted), the covariance matrix of this shifted matrix is
#' the same as the rank matrix of the entire matrix (where the zeros would
#' all also have a rank = (z+1)/2) where z is the number of zeros
#' This rank matrix can then be used to calculate Spearman's correlation coefficient
#' (via pearson correlation)
#' Copied without code changes and only minor changes to the comments, from the public blog repository
